# Bubble-Sort
History
The idea was born from a program on algorithms I was watching on TV.  I then showed it to school age children duing career day about what software developers do.  

General notes
1) To start the game run BubbleSort.exe and click the "Start" button.  This causes boxes of random heights to appear.
2) The sort button will show either "Comparing" or "Switching"
3) The sort is over when there are no switches.
